# Airplane Seat Booking System in C

This repository contains a simple implementation of an Airplane Seat Booking System in C. The program allows users to book seats in a small airplane, view available seats, and get their boarding passes. The code uses a 2D array to represent the airplane seats and assigns 'X' to indicate occupied seats.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:** 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/AirplaneSeatBooking_C.git
   cd AirplaneSeatBooking_C
   ```

2. **Compile and run the program:**
   ```
   gcc AirplaneSeatBooking.c -o airplane_seat_booking
   ./airplane_seat_booking
   ```

3. **Follow the on-screen instructions:** 
   - Choose the number of seats to book.
   - Enter the seat number (1-5) and seat letter (A-D) for each seat.

4. **Get your boarding pass:** 
   Once all seats are booked, the program will confirm your ticket and prompt you to print your boarding pass.

## Note

This implementation is for educational purposes and does not handle complex scenarios or real-time booking systems. It's a basic example to understand 2D arrays and simple seat booking logic.
